# Samhammer.Configuration.Childs

## Usage

#### How to add this to your project:
- reference this package to your project: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Samhammer.Configuration.Childs/

To add it to ASP.NET Core configuration simply place .EnableChildSubstitutions() last. Make sure it is always called after all other configurations are added, else it won't behave properly!

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
   Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
      .ConfigureAppConfiguration((ctx, builder) =>
      {
          // if you have any additional configuration place it before
          var customer = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("CUSTOMER");
          builder.EnableChildSubstitutions(customer);
      });
```

Set enviroment variable 'Customer' to control which child substitutions are loaded in the configuration.
For local development you can do set in launchsettings.json.

```json
"environmentVariables": {
  "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
  "CUSTOMER": "customer1"
}
```

#### When to use it

If you want to deploy multiple production systems (e.g. different customers) and you donÂ´t want to add additional appsettings.json files or additional enviroment variables for all of your settings.

#### How to use it

##### Simple Example

Example where the entry ConnectionString in appsettings.json has some default value and some substitutions values for different customers.

```json
{
  "ConnectionString ": "blabla&catalog=myapp",
  "customer1:ConnectionString ": "blabla&catalog=myapp-customer1",
  "customer2:ConnectionString ": "blabla&catalog=myapp-customer2",
}
```

```csharp
var value = configuration["ConnectionString"];
```

This will return 'blabla&catalog=myapp-customer1'.

##### Additional examples

```json
{
  "DatabaseOptions ": {
    "HostName": "host",
    "CatalogName": "db",
    "UserName": "user"
  },
  "customer1:DatabaseOptions": {
    "CatalogName": "db1",
    "UserName": "user1"  
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "DatabaseOptions ": {
    "HostName": "host",
    "CatalogName": "db",
    "UserName": "user",
    
    "customer1": {
      "CatalogName": "db1",
      "UserName": "user1"  
    }
  }
}
```
